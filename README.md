BKK/hack Resources
==================

This repository (and mainly [its wiki][wiki]) serves to collect curated
resources for learning popular technologies and programming languages, aimed
especially at self-starters who are using their time at [hack night meetups] to
try something new. There are abundant resources available on the web today, but
particularly as a beginner it can be difficult to know where to start.

This is an endless work-in-progressâ€”new learning aids and languages pop up all
the time, so please contribute your favorites.

If you've got a particular language or technology in mind that you're ready to
learn, head to [the wiki][wiki] and see if we have pointers. If you're brand
new to programming, read on.
